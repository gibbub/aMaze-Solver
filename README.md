# aMaze-Solver
A maze generator &amp; solver.

Generate a maze with dimensions of your choosing.
Select an algorithm to solve your maze with, and observe how different algorithms navigate the maze differently!

The current available algorithms to choose from are:
> * DFS (Depth First Search)
> * Dijkstra
> * A*

Also considering implementing:
> * Greedy Best-First
> * BFS
> * Wall-Following
> * Dead-End Filling
> * Tremaux
